 ## Occupancy-Grid-SLAM-for-Autonomous-Ground-Robot

This project was done as a part of ROB550 (Robotics Systems Lab) course in University of Michigan

- Implemented particle filter localization occupancy grid mapping
- Sensors used: 2D LiDAR (for mapping and correction step in localization), IMU (for propogation step in localization)
- Incorporated an exploration strategy to search for new frontiers in the SLAM map and reach them using A* path planning
